      <p>The fifteenth season of the Indian Premier League has begun with much fanfare & will continue till  the 29th. of May 2022.  

The 20 over cricket Tournament that was introduced by BCCI in 2008 mainly to stop the poaching of  young players by the Indian Cricket League promoted by Indian Media Mogul Subhash Chandra along  with the legendary Kapil dev, has now acquired a brand value of USD 6.2 billion in 2019, as per Duff &  Phelps. And now it is being considered as one of the most popular Sports Events of the world  compared with the National Football League( FootBall), the English Premier League (FootBall), the  NBA(Basket Ball) or the National Hockey League(Ice Hockey).According to BCCI, the IPL 2015 Season had contributed USD 150 million to the Indian GDP. However  the Govt. still considers the IPL as entertainment, being Taxed accordingly despite protesting by the  BCCI. However, the IPL has always remained under Cloud for various reasons, since its inception.    </p>

      <p>While China goes on to whitewash its image by showcasing the opening ceremony of Beijing Winter Olympics, Tibetans, Uyghurs, Hongkongers and many thousands of human rights activists will be tuning into https://nobeijing2022.org/iwillnotwatch/ to watch alternative ceremony and videos documenting Chinese atrocities and repression.

International Olympic Committee (IOC) granted 2008 Olympics to People’s Republic of China (PRC) amidst mass uprising in Tibet and massive global protests, claiming that the Games will have positive impact on human rights situation in China. 13 years hence, human rights in China is at its all-time low and China today is one of the most repressive state in the world!</p>

      <h2>At the Australia Open vaccines win, Novak Djokovic loses</h2>
	  <h5>January 7, 2022, 10:20 AM IST Quick Edit in TOI Editorials, Sports, TOI</h5>
      <div class="img">
	    <img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2022%2F0309%2Fr984167_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg" alt="novak" style="height:200px;">

      <p>Australians are huge tennis fans but they are denying entry to Novak Djokovic before he could set foot at the Australian Open, shattering his dream to win a record 21st Grand Slam title or beat Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer with whom he is currently tied for the most men’s singles titles at 20. He was the favorite going in. Not only did he seal a third consecutive win at Melbourne Park last year, he has won here nine times overall.

But we are now in a time of expanding vaccine mandates and Djokovic is not vaccinated. Indeed he has quite a global reputation as an anti-vaxxer. He arrived in Australia with a medical exemption for both vaccination and quarantine. But even as both Tennis Australia and Victoria State were defending the exemption, locals who have seen over 250 days of lockdown were raising an outcry over it. Denying Djokovic entry soothes this outcry but questions remain about why some local authorities vigorously defended the exemption while others rejected it equally vigorously. It speaks to a worldwide woe of individuals caught between different and even contradictory rules and regulations as they navigate international and other borders during the pandemic.
