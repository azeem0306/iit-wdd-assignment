             clothing and footwear. The company has released numerous notable styles of footwear including the 1982<br>
             introduction of the Reebok Freestyle that was manufactured and marketed for women.<br>
             In 1984, the shoe accounted for more than half of the Reebok sales. Following the aerobics trend from the<br> 
             1980s to early 1990s, Reebok also released workout programs called Reebok Step beginning in 1989.The brand also<br> 
             introduced one of their most signature shoes, The Reebok Pump. The footwear collection was released as a men's basketball<br> 
             shoe and the world's first fully adjustable fit controlled with manual air allocation. </p>
